# YOLOv3 Object Detector Implemented in Python

This is a codebase for self-learning so that I can better understand the working of the YOLO alorithms.<br>

I am starting with the simpler YOLOv3 network and will then work up to the more complex versions of the YOLO network like Yolov5, Yolov7 etc.<br>

The official version of Yolov3 was implemented in C
